     <h2>The types of pizza</h2>
     <p>There are a lot of various flavours of pizza. But some of the most famous ones are:</p>

     <h3>Pepperoni Pizza</h3>
     <p>Pepperoni pizza is a classic American favorite featuring a crispy or chewy crust topped with tangy tomato sauce, gooey melted mozzarella cheese, and slices of spicy, savory pepperoni—a cured sausage made from beef and pork. As it bakes, the pepperoni crisps up and curls into little cups, adding a smoky kick to every bite. It's simple, satisfying, and loved for its bold flavor and comforting texture.</p>
