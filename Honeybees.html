The practice dates back to almost 9,000 years ago, according to a 2015 paper published in the journal Nature</P><p>Modern Beekeepers use human-made bee hives that are typically boxes with rows of wooden frames that bees fill with wax hneycomb. The hibves are desinged to give Beekeepers access to collect honey and maintain the nest</p>
